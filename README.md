SIH 1653: Web based Selector-Applicant Simulation Software
## Problem Description
Background: Recruitment and Assessment Centre (RAC) under DRDO, Ministry of Defence carries out interviews for applications received against advertised vacancies and for promotion to next higher grade for scientific manpower inducted within DRDO. Description: The process of interviewing is a challenging task. An unbiased objective interviewing process helps identify the right talent. The basic process of an interview involves posing a set of questions by an interviewer and thereafter evaluating responses from candidates. Thus, the questions asked should be relevant and match the area/ expertise of the applicant and the responses should also be of relevance w.r.t. the question asked. Expected Solution: The proposed solution should provide experts as well as candidates a real life Board Room experience, starting with initial ice-breaking questions leading to in-depth techno-managerial (depending on the level of candidate) questions. It shall also be able to provide a quantifiable score for experts as well as the candidate for the relevancy of questions w.r.t. the area/ expertise of the applicant. Similarly, candidate responses should also be graded for relevancy w.r.t. the question asked, finally assisting in arriving at an overall score for the subject knowledge of the candidate and thus his/ her suitability against the advertised post.

## Idea
To enhance the interview process at the Recruitment and Assessment Centre (RAC) under DRDO, integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) can significantly improve efficiency, reduce biases, and provide a more objective evaluation of candidates. AI-driven tools can analyze candidate responses, both verbal and non-verbal, assessing technical knowledge and behavioral traits. For instance, platforms like HireVue utilize AI to evaluate video interviews, analyzing verbal and facial cues to predict job performance and cultural fit. Implementing such technologies can assist experts in formulating relevant questions tailored to each candidate's expertise, ensuring a more personalized and effective interview experience.

Incorporating AI into the interview process also aids in standardizing evaluations, which is crucial for maintaining fairness and objectivity. Structured interviews, where each candidate is asked the same set of questions, have been shown to have higher interrater reliability and are less prone to biases. AI can facilitate this by generating consistent, job-relevant questions and providing real-time analysis of responses, helping interviewers focus on assessing candidates' suitability for the role based on their expertise and knowledge. This approach aligns with best practices for conducting unbiased interviews, as it minimizes the influence of unconscious biases and ensures that evaluations are based on objective criteria.

Furthermore, AI can assist in mitigating biases that may arise from traditional interview methods. Studies have shown that AI can effectively minimize sentiment-driven biases by analyzing interview dynamics and emphasizing skills and knowledge over emotional sentiments. By implementing AI-driven assessments, RAC can enhance the objectivity of the interview process, ensuring that candidates are evaluated based on their qualifications and fit for the role, rather than subjective perceptions. This technology also supports the creation of a diverse and inclusive hiring process, as AI can be programmed to recognize and counteract potential biases, leading to more equitable outcomes.
